Today I had my first day of lessons at Yamasa, the Japanese language school I'm attending in Okazaki, Japan.
I've been placed in the beginner class, so the lesson was mainly spent on learning hiragana, the most common
of the three Japanese writing systems. I knew it already, and the rest of the class seemed to as well, so
we enjoyed a relatively relaxing start to our studies. We also introduced ourselves to each other. Everyone
seems pretty nice and excited to be there. There are students from America, Brazil, China, Germany, Italy,
Thailand and Vietnam: a good mix. Mr. Yokozawa, our teacher for today (he's rotating with two others), was
positive and energetic.

There's no homework due this week, according to the detailed schedule posted on the
classroom wall, so I had time after class to go to the big shopping centre up the road and continue my
apartment-furnishing odyssey. That's how I've spent most of the preceding week – either on Amazon ordering
large items that I don't want to have to take home on the bus, or at Daiso or Muji buying a load of small
items that I don't want packaged in individual cardboard boxes. (I've just learned that you have to take
cardboard boxes to a recycling collection centre yourself, which is problematic because I currently have 
eleventy billion of them crammed into the space above my fridge.) Fortunately the flat is now well and
truly approaching livable status, so there's less and less of this kind of thing to do.

Last weekend there was a cherry blossom festival at a park a few kilometres away. I went on Saturday evening
and Sunday afternoon to take some photos, which you can see below. This park actually contains Okazaki
Castle, the birthplace and base of one of the most important figures in Japanese history, which is cool, 
but it's not pictured below because I couldn't find a good angle to photograph it from.

I hadn't seen the cherry blossoms in bloom on my previous trips to Japan, so it's been nice to experience
that for the first time. They're all over the place, from historical parks to carparks. It's been a week
since full bloom at this point, so they're starting to shed, and even that's quite beautiful: little
roundish pink and white petals floating through the air and carpeting the ground.

The start of school, shopping and the cherry blossoms: probably the three most salient things of my short
time in Japan so far. I could go on in much more detail but it's getting late and I need to make both 
tonight's dinner and tomorrow's lunch. I'll hopefully write again in a week or sooner; let me know if 
there's anything you want to hear about.
